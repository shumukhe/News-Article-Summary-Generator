# News-Article-Summary-Generator 
[ðŸ”— Live Demo](https://news-article-summary-generator-3yo2nn2zj3atfyazvtxj7u.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains a news article summarization tool that uses a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with attention. It allows users to input a news article and receive a concise summary generated by the model.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Text Input:** Accepts news articles as input via a Streamlit web interface.
*   **Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the input text using regular expressions and spaCy.
*   **Summarization:** Generates summaries using a pre-trained encoder-decoder model.
*   **Streamlit Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
*   **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes pre-trained encoder and decoder models for summarization.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** Primary programming language.
*   **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework.
*   **Streamlit:** Web application framework for creating the user interface.
*   **spaCy:** Library for advanced Natural Language Processing.
*   **Numpy:** Library for Numerical Operations
*   **Pickle:** Library for serializing and deserializing python objects.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** (3.7 or higher recommended)
*   **pip:** Python package installer.

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow numpy spacy pandas
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**Explanation:**

*   `streamlit`: Required for running the web application.
*   `tensorflow`: Required for the deep learning models.
*   `numpy`: Required for numerical operations.
*   `spacy`: Required for text preprocessing.
*   `pandas`: Required for dataframe handling in the preprocessing file.
*   `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`: Downloads the English language model for spaCy.

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shumukhe/News-Article-Summary-Generator.git
    cd News-Article-Summary-Generator
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If you create one
    ```
    (Alternatively install them manually as specified in the Prerequisites section)

3.  **Download the spaCy model:**

    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

4.  **Ensure Model Files are Present:** Make sure the following files are in the same directory as your scripts:
    * `encoder_model.h5`
    * `decoder_model.h5`
    * `x_tokenizer.pkl`
    * `y_tokenizer.pkl`
    * `preprocessing_params.pkl`

## Usage Guide

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This command will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser.

2.  **Interact with the application:**

    *   Paste the news article text into the provided text area.
    *   Click the "Generate Summary" button.
    *   The generated summary will be displayed below the input area.

## API Documentation

N/A. This project does not expose an external API. The summarization logic is contained within the Streamlit application and the helper functions defined in the other python files.
